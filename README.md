The goal of the Caesar-XOR Encryption Decryption Tool Project is to
revive the ancient Caesar cipher, a cryptographic method that dates back to eras
past in ancient Rome, named after Julius Caesar. To encode or decode a
message, the alphabetic letters are shifted to a predetermined number of
positions. In our project, we leverage the fundamental idea of modern
cryptography—XOR (exclusive or) operations—to give this ancient cipher a modern twist.
